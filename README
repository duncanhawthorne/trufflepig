To run:
Will run on ubuntu intrepid (and hopefully above)
Uses samba so should (?) run on most modern *nix
make the folder trufflepig in your home folder

run 
python backend.py
python backend.py ping #for ping only
python backend.py scan 123.456.789.012 #to force scan (ie ignore skipping large sharers) and upload to sql for the named ip only
python backend.py scan #force scan everyone
python backend.py scan quick #scan people who have hit_count != 0 or who mysql says have files shared (not forced)
python backend.py ping quick #ping people who have hit_count != 0 or who mysql says have files shared

use python backend.py once, then normally just with the quick option

Need a file called .trufflepig in your home directory containing (with your values, sensible defaults listed below):

host = 127.0.0.1
port = 3306
user = mysql-username
dbfiles = files
dbhosts = hosts
dbwall = wall
password = password
database = mysql-database-name
ip1 = 192,
ip2 = 168,
ip3 = 0, 1, 2
ip4 = None
website_name = Trufflepig
lan_location = your_group_name
website_has_banner = "no"
website_banner = ./trufflepig.png (put an image here and change "website_has_banner" to yes)
lan_nickname = your_group_name
web_address = your_website_address

Need to install
	python-mysqldb
	python-configobj
	smbfs
	timeout
	fping
	
Need to create a folder called trufflepig in your home directory	

Need to make a database with the name specified in the config file with this format:
	tables:
	files
	hosts
	wall

Can make a .htaccess file to restrict access to people on the local network, for example containing:

order deny,allow
allow from 192.168.
deny from all
DirectoryIndex search.php

(make sure to check the specific ip ranges of your network)
